  # Electronic Health Record Data Warehouse Project

- Developed a Snowflake-based data warehouse to process, analyze, and manage synthetic EHR data
- Designed and implemented a star schema with dimension and fact tables to track patient demographics, conditions, procedures, and other clinical events
- Leveraged views, foreign key constraints, and UUID-based unique identifiers for efficient data modeling and querying

## Future Directions:
- interactive Tableau dashboard -- visualizations
- SAS or Python ML forcasting


Data source:
